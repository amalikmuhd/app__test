## Ticker Component Documentation

The `Ticker` component is responsible for fetching and displaying ticker data in the React Ticker Data application. It utilizes various sub-components and services to manage the state and handle API requests.

### Import Statements

The `Ticker` component imports the following modules and components:

```jsx
import {useState, useEffect, useCallback} from 'react';

import TickerService from '../services/tickerService';
import SelectDropdown from '../components/SelectDropdown';

import TradeData from '../components/TradeData';
import ChartData from '../components/ChartData';
import Loader from '../components/Loader';

import '../styles/Ticker.css';
```

### State Variables

The `Ticker` component manages the following state variables:

- `tickers` (array): Holds the list of available tickers fetched from the `TickerService`.
- `selectedTicker` (string): Stores the currently selected ticker chosen by the user.
- `tickerData` (array): Contains the trade data fetched from the `TickerService` for the selected ticker.
- `loading` (boolean): Indicates whether the component is currently fetching data or not.

### Methods

The `Ticker` component defines the following methods:

- `fetchTickers`: Fetches the list of available tickers from the `TickerService` and updates the `tickers` state variable. It also fetches the trade data for the first ticker in the list and updates the `tickerData` state variable accordingly.
- `handleTickerChange`: Updates the `selectedTicker` state variable when the user selects a new ticker from the dropdown menu. It also fetches the trade data for the selected ticker and updates the `tickerData` state variable.

### Lifecycle Hooks

The `Ticker` component utilizes the following lifecycle hooks:

- `useEffect`: Invoked on component mount to fetch the list of tickers using the `fetchTickers` method. It also monitors changes to the `selectedTicker` state variable and triggers the `handleTickerChange` method accordingly.

### Rendered Elements

The `Ticker` component renders the following elements:

- `<h1 className="title">`: Displays the title of the application.
- `<SelectDropdown>`: Renders the dropdown menu for selecting a ticker, passing the necessary props for the selected ticker, change event handling, and loading state.
- `<TradeData>`: Renders the trade data component, passing the selected ticker and trade data as props.
- `<ChartData>`: Renders the chart data component, passing the selected ticker and trade data as props.
- `<Loader>`: Renders the loader component when the `loading` state variable is true.

### Styling
