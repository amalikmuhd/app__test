## Code Documentation: `Loader` Component

The `Loader` component is a React functional component that displays a loading spinner or loader animation. Here's the documentation for this code:

### Import

The component imports a CSS file named `"../styles/loader.css"`. This file likely contains styles for the loader animation, which will be applied to the rendered elements.

### Return Value

The `Loader` component returns a JSX element representing the loader animation.

### JSX Structure

The JSX structure of the `Loader` component is as follows:

```jsx
<div className="loaderContainer">
  <div className="lds-ring">
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### JSX Explanation

- The outermost `div` element has the class name `"loaderContainer"` and serves as the container for the loader component.
- Inside the `loaderContainer`, there is a `div` element with the class name `"lds-ring"`, which represents the loader animation.
- Within the `lds-ring` element, there are four child `div` elements, each representing a segment of the loader animation.
- The loader animation is typically displayed as a rotating ring or set of dots, with each `div` representing a segment or dot.

Please note that the appearance and behavior of the loader animation are defined in the associated CSS file (`"../styles/loader.css"`), which contains the necessary styles for the loader to animate properly.

Additionally, ensure that the CSS file path provided in the import statement is correct and matches the actual location of the CSS file in your project structure.
