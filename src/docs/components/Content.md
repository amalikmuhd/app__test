## Content Component

The `Content` component represents the main content area of a webpage. It includes three sub-components: `ChartData`, `TradeToday`, and `Market`. This component is responsible for rendering these sub-components and passing necessary props to them.

### Props

- `loading` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the data is currently being loaded. If `true`, the loading state will be displayed in the `Market` component.
- `tickerData` (object): The data related to the selected ticker. This data is passed to the `ChartData`, `TradeToday`, and `Market` components.
- `selectedTicker` (string): The currently selected ticker symbol. This is used to display the relevant data in the `TradeToday` and `Market` components.
- `setShowDropdown` (function): A function to control the visibility of the dropdown menu in the `TradeToday` component. When called with `true`, the dropdown menu will be shown.
- `showDropdown` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the dropdown menu in the `TradeToday` component is visible. This is used to control the visibility of the dropdown menu.

### Example Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Content from './Content';

const App = () => {
  const loading = false;
  const tickerData = {
    // Ticker data object
  };
  const selectedTicker = 'BTC';
  const setShowDropdown = (show) => {
    // Set the visibility of the dropdown menu
  };
  const showDropdown = false;

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other content */}
      <Content
        loading={loading}
        tickerData={tickerData}
        selectedTicker={selectedTicker}
        setShowDropdown={setShowDropdown}
        showDropdown={showDropdown}
      />
      {/* More content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Code Explanation

- Import the necessary dependencies: `ChartData`, `Market`, and `TradeToday` components.
- Define a functional component named `Content` that takes in the props: `loading`, `tickerData`, `selectedTicker`, `setShowDropdown`, and `showDropdown`.
- Render the content structure using JSX within the `return` statement.
  - The root element is a `div` with the CSS class `content-container` to contain the content.
  - Inside the `content-container`, there is another `div` with the CSS class `card-container` to contain the sub-components.
  - The `ChartData` component is rendered with the `tickerData` prop, passing the data related to the selected ticker for displaying a chart.
  - The `TradeToday` component is rendered with the props: `selectedTicker`, `setShowDropdown`, and `showDropdown`, passing the selected ticker, the function to control the dropdown menu visibility, and the current visibility state of the dropdown menu.
  - The `Market` component is rendered with the props: `loading`, `selectedTicker`, and `tickerData`, passing the loading state, the selected ticker, and the ticker data for displaying market information.
- Export the `Content` component as the default export.

Ensure that the necessary sub-components (`ChartData`, `Market`, and `TradeToday`) are imported correctly for the `Content` component to function properly.
