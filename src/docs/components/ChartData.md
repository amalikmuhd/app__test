## Code Documentation: `ChartData` Component

The `ChartData` component is a React functional component that displays ticker data in the form of a chart. It takes two props: `selectedTicker` and `tickerData`. Here's the documentation for this code:

### Props

- `selectedTicker` (string): The selected ticker symbol or name to be displayed in the chart heading.
- `tickerData` (array of arrays): An array of trade data points for the selected ticker. Each trade data point is represented by an array with three elements:
  - `trade[0]` (string or number): The trade identifier or timestamp (not used in the chart).
  - `trade[1]` (number): The opening price of the trade.
  - `trade[2]` (number): The closing price of the trade.

### Return Value

The `ChartData` component returns a JSX element representing the chart data.

### JSX Structure

The JSX structure of the `ChartData` component is as follows:

```jsx
<div className="ticker-data">
  <h2 className="ticker-heading">{selectedTicker} Data:</h2>
  <div className="chart">
    {tickerData.map((trade, index) => (
      <div
        key={index}
        className={`chart-item`}
        style={{
          height: `${Math.abs(trade[1] - trade[2])}%`,
          background: trade[1] - trade[2] > 0 ? 'red' : 'green',
        }}
      ></div>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
```

#### JSX Explanation

- The `div` element with the class name `"ticker-data"` serves as the container for the entire chart data component.
- The `h2` element with the class name `"ticker-heading"` displays the selected ticker name or symbol followed by the text " Data:". It represents the heading of the chart.
- The `div` element with the class name `"chart"` is the container for the chart items.
- Inside the chart container, there is a mapping function used to iterate over each `trade` item in the `tickerData` array.
- For each `trade` item, a `div` element is rendered with the class name `"chart-item"`.
- The `key` prop is set to the index of the `trade` item in the `tickerData` array to provide a unique identifier for React.
- The style prop is used to set the height of each `chart-item` based on the difference between the opening and closing prices of the trade.
- The background color of each `chart-item` is set to "red" if the closing price is lower than the opening price (indicating a decrease) and "green" otherwise (indicating an increase).

Please note that this documentation assumes familiarity with React and JSX syntax.
