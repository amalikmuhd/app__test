Documentation for `.container` CSS class:

The `.container` class is used to style a container element. It has the following properties:

- `margin: 0 auto;` - Sets the margin on the top and bottom to 0 and automatically centers the container horizontally within its parent element by applying automatic margins on the left and right.
- `display: flex;` - Configures the container as a flex container, allowing its child elements to be arranged in a flexible layout.
- `flex-direction: column;` - Sets the direction of the flex container to be vertical, arranging its child elements in a column layout.

Example Usage:

```html
<div class="container">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>
```

In the above example, the `.container` class is applied to a `<div>` element to create a container. You can replace the `<!-- Content goes here -->` comment with the actual content you want to display within the container.

Note: Make sure to link the appropriate CSS file containing the `.container` class to your HTML file for the styles to be applied correctly.
