## CSS Documentation: Loader Styles

The provided code contains CSS styles for a loader animation. Here's the documentation for this code:

### `.loaderContainer`

- `display: flex;`: Sets the container element to use flexbox layout.
- `width: 100%;`: Sets the container element's width to 100% of its parent container.
- `height: 100%;`: Sets the container element's height to 100% of its parent container.
- `justify-content: center;`: Horizontally centers the child elements within the container using flexbox.
- `align-items: center;`: Vertically centers the child elements within the container using flexbox.

### `.lds-ring`

- `display: inline-block;`: Sets the element to be an inline-block, which allows other inline elements to flow around it.
- `position: relative;`: Positions the element relative to its normal position.
- `width: 80px;`: Sets the width of the element to 80 pixels.
- `height: 80px;`: Sets the height of the element to 80 pixels.

### `.lds-ring div`

- `box-sizing: border-box;`: Includes the element's borders and padding within its total width and height.
- `display: block;`: Sets the element to be a block-level element, taking up the full width available.
- `position: absolute;`: Positions the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
- `width: 64px;`: Sets the width of the element to 64 pixels.
- `height: 64px;`: Sets the height of the element to 64 pixels.
- `margin: 8px;`: Sets the margin around the element to 8 pixels.
- `border: 8px solid #fff;`: Sets the border of the element to a solid white color with a width of 8 pixels.
- `border-radius: 50%;`: Sets the border radius of the element to create a circular shape.
- `animation: lds-ring 1.2s cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.5, 1) infinite;`: Applies the `lds-ring` animation to the element, specifying a duration of 1.2 seconds, an easing function, and an infinite repetition.
- `border-color: red transparent transparent transparent;`: Sets the border color of the element, with the top border being red and the other borders being transparent.

### `.lds-ring div:nth-child(n)`

- `animation-delay: -x;`: Sets a negative delay for the animation of each child element, creating a sequential animation effect. The delay values (-0.45s, -0.3s, -0.15s) indicate the time offset at which each child element starts its animation.

### `@keyframes lds-ring`

- `0%`: Specifies the styles for the element at the beginning of the animation (0% progress).
- `100%`: Specifies the styles for the element at the end of the animation (100% progress).
- `transform: rotate(xdeg);`: Applies a rotation transformation to the element, animating it from 0 degrees to 360 degrees.

The provided CSS code defines styles for a loader animation that displays as a set of concentric rings rotating clockwise. The animation is achieved using CSS keyframes and transforms. The loader is centered within its container using flexbox.

Please note that this documentation provides an overview of the CSS styles and their purpose. The actual appearance and behavior of the loader animation will depend on how these styles are applied and integrated into the HTML structure of your application.
