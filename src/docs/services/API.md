## Code Documentation: Axios API Instance

The code provided defines an Axios API instance using the `axios` library. Here's the documentation for this code:

### Import

The component imports the `axios` library, which provides functionality for making HTTP requests.

### Axios API Instance

The `API` constant is assigned the value of a new Axios instance created using the `axios.create()` method. This instance allows for customization and configuration of the Axios library.

#### Configuration

The Axios instance is configured with an options object passed as an argument to the `create()` method. In this case, the options object specifies the `headers` property with an object containing a single header:

```javascript
headers: {
  Accept: "*/*", // Required for CORS support to work
},
```

The `Accept` header is set to `"*/*"`, which indicates that the client can accept any media type in the response. This header is commonly used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues.

### Export

The `API` instance is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of the codebase.

Please note that this documentation provides an overview of the code's purpose and usage. The full functionality and usage of the `API` instance will depend on how it is utilized in the application.
